# Carefam Investor Update — Voice Profile

**Author:** Matan (CEO and co-founder, Carefam)
**Based on:** 20 investor updates (Nov 2023 – Jan 2026)
**Purpose:** This document captures the structure, tone, style, recurring metrics, and patterns found across all of Matan's investor updates, to serve as the blueprint for an AI agent that drafts future updates.

---

## 1. Overall Structure

Every update follows a consistent template. The sections appear in this order:

1. **Title** — Month + Year (e.g., "January '25 Update" or "March Update" for earlier ones; later shifted to "January 2026")
2. **Greeting** — "Dear Investors," (always)
3. **Welcome line** — "Welcome to our monthly update! (Reading time: X minutes, Y seconds)"
4. **TLDR** — A single paragraph summarizing the key highlights, separated by semicolons. This is the most important section for busy investors. Typically 3–5 highlights.
5. **Monthly KPIs** — A short block of 4–5 metrics with MoM % change in parentheses
6. **Marketplace (Placements & Facilities)** — Broken into sub-bullets:
   - Supply side (candidates)
   - Demand side (facilities)
   - Operational efficiency
7. **R&D, Product, Design** — (section name varies slightly: "Product & Design" in earlier updates, later standardized to "R&D, Product, Design")
8. **Other Things Happening** — Team additions, conferences, travel, personal updates
9. **Asks** — Specific requests for introductions or help from investors (not always present)
10. **Closing** — "As always, happy to chat further regarding any of the above."
11. **Sign-off** — "Best, / Matan / CEO and co-founder / Carefam" (sometimes preceded by "Hoping everyone is safe and well," in earlier updates during the Israel-Gaza period)

## 2. KPIs Tracked

The KPIs have evolved over time but stabilized into this set:

| KPI | Tracked Since | Notes |
|-----|---------------|-------|
| New Carefam Talent Profiles (with a Match) | Always | Core supply metric |
| Recruiters on Platform | ~Mid 2024 | Added as demand-side indicator |
| Facilities | ~Mid 2024 | Replaced "Customers" count |
| Monthly Interviews | Always | Core funnel metric |
| Candidates Started Work | Always | Core outcome metric (placements) |

**Format:** Each KPI is listed on its own line with the number followed by (% change MoM) in green for positive, red for negative. Example:
```
New Carefam Talent Profiles with a Match: 1040 (+7.5%)
Recruiters on Platform: 44 (-)
Facilities: 157 (-)
Monthly Interviews: 193 (+45%)
Candidates started work: 39 (+56%)
```

## 3. Tone & Writing Style

### Voice Characteristics
- **Direct and transparent** — Matan doesn't sugarcoat bad news. When there's a decline, he explains why openly (e.g., the "bug" that caused a 50% drop in registrations in June '24, or the holiday slowdown in Dec '24)
- **Optimistic but grounded** — Good news is celebrated with enthusiasm but always tied to specifics. Phrases like "our best month yet" are common but always backed by data
- **Conversational** — The tone is warm and personal, not corporate. He uses contractions ("we've," "we're," "I'll"), occasional emojis (sparingly, usually 🙂 or 😄), and personal anecdotes
- **Action-oriented** — Focus is on what was done, what was learned, and what's next
- **Appreciative of investors** — Regularly thanks investors for introductions and acknowledges their role in growth

### Recurring Phrases & Patterns
- "our best month yet" (used frequently when hitting new records)
- "as always, happy to chat further regarding any of the above"
- "hoping everyone is safe and well" (used during 2024 updates; dropped by 2025)
- "please let me know if you'll be attending" (re: conferences)
- "no idea is too small, so please feel free to reach out"
- Intros from investors described as having "been instrumental in our growth to date"
- "back to our regularly scheduled programming" (used when returning after a gap or special section)

### What Matan DOESN'T Do
- Never uses jargon without context
- Never sounds defensive about setbacks — frames them as learning opportunities
- Never pads the update with filler content — each section has substance
- Never makes vague commitments — goals are specific ("sign by end of month," "release date of November 7")
- Doesn't use excessive formatting or headers beyond the standard sections

## 4. Section-by-Section Patterns

### TLDR
- Always a single paragraph
- Key highlights separated by semicolons
- Covers: marketplace/placements performance, notable deals or milestones, product/R&D highlights, team additions, upcoming events
- Reads as a standalone summary — an investor could read only this and know the state of the business
- Typical length: 4–8 lines

### Marketplace Section
- **Supply side** always comes first, then Demand, then Ops efficiency
- Supply updates cover: candidate acquisition volume, new channels tested, quality improvements
- Demand updates cover: new customers signed, expansion within existing customers, pipeline deals, state expansion
- Ops efficiency covers: process improvements, SOP work, seasonal effects, funnel optimization
- Each sub-section uses a bold label followed by a period, then the content (e.g., "**Supply side (candidates).** We've been growing...")

### R&D / Product Section
- Features are described in terms of their impact on the hiring funnel, not technical implementation
- Often includes context on WHY a feature matters (e.g., "this step is known to be a moment in the hiring funnel that sees huge dropoff")
- Progress on longer-term projects (like the candidate app) is tracked month over month
- AI/agent capabilities are highlighted prominently when relevant

### Other Things Happening
- New team members: always includes their name (underlined/linked), title, and 1-2 sentence background
- Conferences: names the specific conference, location, and asks if investors are attending
- Personal travel or team visits
- Occasionally includes photos (earlier updates had images of the team)

### Asks
- Very specific: names of target organizations, states, or types of connections needed
- Often includes context on why (e.g., "these organizations many times have a longer sales cycle, so the earlier we can talk to them the better")
- Framed warmly, not demandingly
- Sometimes includes named contacts at target organizations

## 6. Reading Time
- Always included in the welcome line
- Ranges from ~2 minutes to ~3:45

- Sub-bullets under Marketplace use bold labels with periods
- KPIs use plain text with colored percentages (green for positive, red for negative)
- Team member names are underlined (hyperlinked in original)
- Occasional charts or screenshots embedded (candidate activity graphs, Slack screenshots of agent behavior)
